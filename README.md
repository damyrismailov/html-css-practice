# HTML & CSS Practice

Collection of small HTML/CSS exercises from a web development course. The goal is to practise basic structure, semantics, and styling, not to ship production-ready projects.

## Contents

Each folder is a separate mini-exercise, for example:

- 2.1 Heading Elements  
- 2.2 Paragraph Elements  
- 3.0 List Elements  
- 3.2 Anchor Elements  
- 3.3 Image Elements  
- 4.3 Birthday Invite Project  
- 5.1 Adding CSS  
- 5.3 CSS Selectors  
- 6.0 CSS Colors  
- 6.1 Font Properties  
- 6.3 CSS Box Model  
- 6.4 Motivation Meme Project  
- plus small assets (images, etc.)

Names follow the original course structure.

## What this repo shows

- Basic HTML5 structure: <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <body>  
- Use of common elements: headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images  
- External CSS with <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">  
- Core CSS concepts:
  - colours, fonts, text styling  
  - margins, padding, borders (box model)  
  - simple layout and alignment  
- Importing and using Google Fonts

This is practice code, not a main portfolio project.

## How to run

1. Clone the repo:

   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/html-css-practise.git  
   cd html-css-practise  

2. Open any folder and then open its index.html or solution.html file in a browser  
   (double-click it or use the VS Code “Live Server” extension).

Each exercise is independent; there is no build step.

## Tech stack

- HTML5  
- CSS3  

## Notes

- File and folder names are kept close to the course material for easier revision.  
- Larger, more complete web projects (responsive layouts, JavaScript, etc.) will live in separate repositories.
